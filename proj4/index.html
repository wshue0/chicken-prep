    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we learned how to model fabrics as a mesh of springs that are governed by physical laws that we model using Verlet Integration.
      First, we implemented the various spring connections between vertices in a plane of cloth. Next, we were able to implement physics simulations
      using numerical Verlet Integration. Next, we were able to add lighting to our cloth by implementing various shaders with includes simple, diffuse,
      phong, bump, displacement, and texture mapping. Through the various shaders, we learned about the components that make up shader program including
      the various contributions of different light phenomenon (diffuse, ambient, specular). Lastly, it was interesting to see how physical parameters
      such as the spring constant and density of the cloth influences how it behaves under physics simulations. It was interesting to see also how the various
      diffuse/specular constants affected the visual look of the cloth in phong, bump, displacement mapping. Just by tweaking said parameters the cloth takes
      on different feels ranging from shiny and lustrous to dull and rubbery.

    <p>
      It seems the higher the spring constant the more the cloth rebounds after falling down. At low ks, the cloth comes stiffly to a stop without much rippling.

        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      At higher densities, the cloth droops quickly near the pinned side and sags before the rest of the free cloth descends. At low densities, the cloth falls more uniformly.
    </p>

    <p>

      falls extremely slowly and stiffly stops.

    <p>
      It seems the spring constant is describing how "stretchy or elastic" the cloth becomes. At 500 ks the cloth has a lot of wrinkles and stretches further down over the ball. It seems 
      it gets pulled down by its weight more than at higher ks values.
      As ks approaches 50000, the fabric seems "stiffer" and does not stretch down as much, stopping mid way in a frayed configuration.

    <p>
      With higher density the cloth has more wrinkles that immediately form and it falls faster as well. It looks like it just goes directly down without much lateral deviation. 
      At a lower density it falls slower and takes more time to make longer and more elaborate folds. It looks like it folds more onto itself by billowing out.
      At lower ks, the cloth folds in a more compact manner (more folds, but each one is smaller)
      At higher ks, the cloth folds less number of times, but the folds are bigger (similar to behavior of a lower density cloth).

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a type of isolated, graphics program that manipulates the vertex's position and color using
      vectors and matrices. The vertex shader calculates the position, normal, and other space properties and transforms vertices. The
      fragment shader calculates the color that a vertex should have.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn_phong shading model has a light effect with 3 parts: uniform ambient light, diffuse light, and specular light.
      Uniform ambient light hits every vertex. Diffuse light doesn't depend on the viewing direction and is calculated using
      Lambertian law. Specular light simulates the reflected light.

    <p>
      Bump mapping displays the texture with height deviations without changing the actual positions of the vertices.
      Displacement mapping actually modifies the position of the vertices to reflect the texture and thus it is more realistic.
      The sphere that was rendered using the coarser settings is smoother and has a less jagged surface. The finer mesh
      has more deviations in vertex position and thus it has more jagged bumps and edges on its surface.
