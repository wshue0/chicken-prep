        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>In this project, we were able to implement the proper rendering of mirror and glass materials in part 1, as well as depth of field effects in part 4. 
            Part 1 was not difficult to implement, but was an interesting exercise in thinking about how the max bounce limit effects the image produced.
            In real life, many of the intricate visual patterns associated with glass and mirrors are caused by refraction and reflection, which we mathematically model
            by using snell's law and fresnel equations in the project. The series of pictures with increasing max ray depth showcased just what was required to create reflections 
            of the environment and even reflections of refractive materials. In part 4, we simply had to implement the ray-gathering model of a thin-lens camera,
            we accomplished this by initializating the vectors and rays according to the diagram, which was very helpful. It was a little tricky getting the directions and signs 
            right at first, but the end result was pretty cool since we could see how a scene gets progressively blurrier based on the focal distance and aperture setting.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
        </b>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In the pinhole camera model, all light is travels through a single point on the lens plane, meaning that light can be directly sampled with a ray that
            is directed from the environment to the image sensor. This allows everything to be in focus no matter the distance. However, in the thin-lens model, we can now sample in a specific disk on the lens plane, 
            so only objects in the focal plane will be focused in the camera's view. This is because the only light that can reach the sensor must pass through the lens and get refracted and due
            to the physics of refraction, this limits the focused environment to just a plane in the z-axis (depth). This models environments more realistically, because real world cameras and the human eye can only focus on
            objects in a certain range of distances at a given times, which is what causes the depth of field effect.
